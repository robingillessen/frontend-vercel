## Changelog

### 12-02-2025

Project setup

- Added Next.js 15
- Added React 19\*
- Added D3
- Added zustand for managing global client state
- Bun for package manager / build tool / runtime\*\*
- Added tailwind for styling
- Added eslint for linting

\* React 19 is stable for a couple of months now.

\*\* I chose bun as the package manager / build tool / runtime because it's faster than npm and yarn and I expect less dependency issues with React 19. If we need to switch to npm or yarn, we can do it later.
